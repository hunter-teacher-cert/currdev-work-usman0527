One language that I would like to teach my engineering class is Javascript. 
Answer the following prompts:
What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
  The course would be my 12th grade engineering class. Their level of exposure to coding would be minimal since most of our CS classes are taught as electives. 
What is the language?
Javascript
How does one write & run code in this language?
I will be using Coding Rooms to implement the code. It's the most user friendly interface out there. 
Rate the complexity of the syntax?
I choose Javascript as an introduction into coding because it is not that complex. Students can learn basic features of javascript and it is visual enough so that they don't get discouraged by the code. 
Strengths
How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?
I would utilize the strengths by having students create individual webpages that they can show to classes that portray their interests and serve as visual representations of their identity. 
Weaknesses
How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Why did you select this language for this class?
I chose this language because it is a nice way to introduce students to coding who have minimal experience.
