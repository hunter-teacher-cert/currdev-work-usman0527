Lesson 1

Do Now: Students will analyze an image that has Snap coding and determine why it is considered an abstraction.

Mini Lesson: In Snap Coding, whenever we created our own blocks, they were known as abstractions. But now they’re known as functions. 
What is the name of this function from the code written above? And what is being passed into it?

Answer: Function name is mystery function. The input of 1 is passed into it. 

Notes: A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.


Turn and Talk: Students will look at an image of a function being called in Python. 

With your partner, answer the following two questions:

How do we create a function?
How do we call a function?


Notes:
From a function's perspective: A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.



Class Call Out: (Students will analyze a Python code)

What is the function name? What are the parameters? What are the arguments?
Notice we can have more than one parameter in our function.


Turn and Talk: (Students will analyze a Python code)
Why would this code return an error?



Activity:


Create a program that calls on a function named greeting that passes in parameters for your first name and prints out a greeting such as, “Hello Usman!”
Create a program that calls on a function named greeting that passes in parameters for your first name, last name and course and prints out a greeting such as “Hello Usman Ahmed from Computer Science Principles!”




Lesson 2

Aim: SWBAT create programs that call on multiple functions with multiple parameters passing through them. 

Do Now:
Students will analyze the following Python code and determine what prints by choosing a multiple choice response.

def add_two(num):
    num = num + 2
    print(num)

def add_three(nums):
    nums = nums + 3
    print(nums)

hi = 4
add_two(hi)
add_three(hi)

Mini Lesson:
Students will go to the following CSAwesome page. https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/functions/parametersandargs.html

With their partner, they will scroll to the bottom of the page and arrage the blocks in proper order so they can construct a code with four functions that prints out a student's GPA, name and attendance. 

As a class we will discuss the proper order of execution and indentation. 

Activity:
Students will create a program that passes two numbers into a parameter and instantiates four functions. One that adds the numbers and prints, one that multiplies the number and prints, one that divides the numbers and prints, and one that finds the mod. 

At the end of the lesson, students will share their programs with the class.
