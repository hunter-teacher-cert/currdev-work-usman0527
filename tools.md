 1) One tool that I use in the classroom heavily is the timer. Usually I find it on Microsoft but sometimes if I'm being extra spicy, I find one on Youtube. I usually use the timer for all of my projects and activities. It sets an urgency to each activity. It also makes sure I'm on pace as a teacher. The countdown clock is an amazing tool.


 2) Another tool that I always use is any method that can project words, images and or video onto the screen. During the pandemic I used Google Meet and Zoom. I would always have something displayed on the screen. Even when I'm in person, I always have something of substance, something about my lesson, on my board. It refocus the audience. They remember what they are doing better.
