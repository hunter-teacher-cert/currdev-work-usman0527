### 9-12.CT6

#### Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task. 

An activity that would be great for this would be to show the difference between a for loop and a while loop. Students can analyze situations where an interation is needed and they can then determine which loop works best. Students can elaborate on their reasoning in a group discussion setting. This would allow them to analyze two different types of algorithms and determine the trade-offs of each. 

### 9-12.IC.2

#### Debate laws and regulations that impact the development and use of computing technologies and digital information. 

An activity that could work is to analyze the idea of censorship on the internet. Is a private company exempt from the laws of free speech? Students will research the topic and debate these issues with real world evidence that they have found. This activity allows them to debate laws and regulations that impact the development of digital information.
