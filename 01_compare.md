The two curriculums that I am analyzing are BJC versus CodeHS.

A major difference between the two is the coding language. BJC is block based while CodeHS leans towards learning through Python. Our school started with BJC but we’ve been fortunate enough to gain access to CodeHS. Though I always loved block based programming because of its ability to teach the concepts without being bogged down with the syntax, I am changing my opinion as I use Code HS more. I think learning python prepares them better for CS A when they have to learn java. Furthermore, CodeHS has a better template and more features and resources than BJC. But I guess that’s what happens when you pay for things. 

In terms of similarities, both curriculums follow the same structure in terms of when topics are introduced. At first, CodeHS develops code that is visual. It’s like BJC with Alonzo and sprite manipulation and similar to CS Awesome as well with the turtle movements. Then, the similarity of the structure continues when introducing loops and moving onto lists. This structure seems to be the same in all the curriculums. 

Comparatively speaking, there are benefits and drawbacks to both sides. BJC allows a more visual template where students can learn the concepts of coding in a way that seems more friendly and hands on. It’s visual. And you don’t have to worry about syntax. However, there is a much steeper learning curve moving from BJC to Java. On the other hand, coding in Python through CodeHS deals with that learning curve right from the beginning. Students are learning both the syntax and the concepts. This makes teaching much slower but the students will have an easier time transitioning to Java. 

The ideal course, I believe, should have both. Start with BJC and transition to CodeHS. Or maybe run both curriculums simultaneously. Of course, there is the issue of time. But, with experience and the right planning, I believe it can be done. It may be the key to teaching concepts and syntax to new learners in a way that doesn’t scare them.
