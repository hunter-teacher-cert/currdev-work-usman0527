A new computer science course that I would like to teach is a combination of Computer Science Principles and Computer Science A. The general description of the course would be to teach the concept first using block coding and then immediately teach the same concept using an object oriented programming language like python or java. The target audience would be 10th-11th grade students and it would come before CS A. In fact, it would replace the BJC curriculum that we currently use.  

The reason I believe that this would be an important course is because it would help students prepare for the pseudo code portions of the CS P exam while also preparing them for CS A. We could teach movement of sprites through block based programming and immediately move to CS Awesome where they teach the same concepts using the turtle. Loops and algorithms could be taught the exact same way. By the time we get to arrays, the CSP curriculum would be complete and we can begin to move into classes, objects and instances in Java or Python. 

This course would be ideal for beginners and students with intermediate knowledge of coding because as I have it right now, there is a huge gap between students who have had previous coding experience and students who have never tried coding in their lives.
